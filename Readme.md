#QRISK®3-2017
A javascript port of [QRISK®3](https://qrisk.org/three/index.php). The QRISK®3 algorithm calculates a person's risk of developing a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years. It presents the average risk of people with the same risk factors as those entered for that person.

### Installation
```bash
npm install sisuwellness-qrisk3
```

### Usage
Two steps are involved:
 1. Build the input object using the helper method (although you can do it manually).
 2. Call `calculateScore` method with input object.
 
 **Example:**

```bash
const qrisk = require("sisuwellness-qrisk3");

const {calculateScore, inputBuilder} = qrisk;
const { Sex, Ethnicity, DiabetesStatus, SmokingStatus } = inputBuilder;
const aboutYou = inputBuilder.buildAboutYou(75, Sex.female, Ethnicity.white);
const clinical = inputBuilder.buildClinical(
    SmokingStatus.nonSmoker,
    DiabetesStatus.none,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false,
    false
);
const bmi = 70 / (1.7 * 1.7);
const biometric = inputBuilder.buildBiometrics(4, 120, 10, bmi);
const qriskInput = inputBuilder.buildQriskInput(aboutYou, clinical, biometric);
const score = calculateScore(qriskInput);

```

#### Calculation

##### calculateScore(qriskInput)
* Returns QRISK score.

* The `qriskInput` definitions are based on [Development and validation of QRISK3 risk prediction algorithms to estimate future risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective cohort study](https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2099) and the namings are based on the [QRISK®3-2018 Online Calculator](https://qrisk.org/three/):
